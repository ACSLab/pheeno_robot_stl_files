# pheeno_robot_stl_files


## Pheeno Version 2.0

This is the ACSLab GitHub repository for the files relating to the construction of the Pheeno robot platform. Pheeno is designed to be an inexpensive (cost of parts = $420), research-level platform for multi-robot experiments, robotics education, and outreach activities. This repository will be updated with additional modules, code, and improvements to existing modules as they are developed.

Thanks for checking out the robot!
